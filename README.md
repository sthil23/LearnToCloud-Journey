# LearnToCloud-Journey
This is my hands-on learning journey through the LearnToCloud guide.
I am an up-and-coming cloud engineer who has been very devoted to the self-taught approach making my way into the IT/Cloud field. My eagerness to learn and grow within this field only gets stronger the more I progress and grasp onto new concepts. As I continue to apply my knowledge into projects/labs my line of understanding becomes less and less blurry.
I will be tracking my growth through applied learning and daily notes on my way to completing this guide. Throughout this guide, various concepts will be covered spanning from the basics of Python to the fundamentals of DevOps and much much more. Stay tuned.

Welcome to the Journey!
