# Phase1-Day2

## What I learned
- Difference between console, command line (CLI), terminal, and Shell.
    - The **console** is the physical device that allows you to interact with the computer
    - A **terminal** is a text input and output environment. It is a program that acts as a wrapper and allows us to enter commands that the computer processes.
    - A **shell** is a program that acts as a command-line interpreter. It processes commands and outputs the results.
    - The **CLI** is the interface in which we enter commands for the computer to process. Practically identical as the terminal, sometimes used interchangeably.
- **IaC** (Infrastructure as Code) is a mainstream pattern for managing infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface or manual command line script sequences.
    - It allows you to build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, trackable, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.

## Tasks completed
- Installed Azure CLI within WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
