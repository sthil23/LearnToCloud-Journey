# Phase1-Day1

## What I learned
- Practiced basic git commands \(git push, git add, git commit, etc).
- Increased familiarity with using bash/vscode.

## Takeaways
- git commit saves changes locally, but not yet saved to the remote repository.
- git push uploads committed changes to the remote repository.
